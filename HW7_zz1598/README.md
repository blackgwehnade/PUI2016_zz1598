## Assignment 1
### I really like the layout of Bokeh so I picked a sample to visualize the counts of chord changes in 13 sound tracks by Linkin Park. 
I picked the counts of 0-6 major chords and 0-6 minor chords a song has changed to from the previous chord.

Please let me know if you still have problem visualizing the chart.
