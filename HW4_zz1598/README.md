# HW4 Information

### * Groupwork: In addition to individual work, I also discussed some thoughts with Dongjie Fan about finding the best way to interpret each statistcal test and their implications. We helped each other understand the differences between the tests. He helped me on the usage of some built-in functions. ; I helped him with pointing out some minor mistakes in his answers to Assignment 3 and 4. I also consulted Google for understanding some concepts of statistical plotting.

## Assignment 1
### The assigned classmate is Akshay Kumar Varma Penmatcha (akp418)

### It was a great chance connecting with other people's thoughts on the same question I did. It inspired me as well. It was worth a discussion about the differences in our approaches.

## Assignment 2
### For this assignment I felt I had to read certain parts of the articles I chose. Especially for the MANCOVA I picked, when I read it, I felt uncertain about whether or not I interpreted the experiment's methodology and results correctly. I will discuss more about it with other people later.

## Assignment 3
### I did this assignment before doing other assignments. I firstly used the old version of the workflow and finished filling out the two by two table. Then when the new version came out, I redid it with the felony data. Please find answers for both old and new versions of the requirements.

## Assignment 4 & extra credit
### After this exercise, I felt more familiar with using pandas' data frame to wrangle data. But I realized that the most important thing before adjusting the dataframe or performing the test should be to understand the question and the test, and know clearly what attributes of data sets I want to compare! Otherwise, it will be a painful "back and forth" process that is time consuming...
### I need to look into when each one of these tests (K-S, Pearson and Spearman) is suitable (under which circumstance it is the most reliable?)
