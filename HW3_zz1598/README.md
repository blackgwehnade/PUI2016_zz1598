## Assignment 1:
I consulted Dr.Bianco's sample code of plotting a histogram and sample means of a Chi-Squared distribution. 
The five distributions I worked on are Gaussian, Poisson, Bionomial, Chi-Squared and Logistic, where the logistic distribution has more spreaded sample means compared to the others when the size is relatively samll.
#### Challenges:
1. The concept of the number of samples and their sizes with respect to their effects on the distributions.
2. Plotting a fit curve on the histogram of the means of the 5 distributions.

## Assignment 2:
I worked with Dongjie Fan as a group; I also discussed with Henry Lin during processing data.
It is a great experience going through Dr.Bianco's steps on how to conduct a hypothesis test from getting data to plotting graphs.
#### Challenges:
1. Writing the code for getting data and put the files into the PUIDATA directory in the way I wanted.
2. Manipulating the pandas datafame functions. (Need more practise)
3. Understanding how to formulate and plot reasonable error and error bars.

## Assignment 3:
I reviewed the class slides and some materials about the hypothesis test.
#### Challenges:
1. When to use one tailed or two tailed test. Which one would fit our assignment better?
2. markdown format for formulaes!
