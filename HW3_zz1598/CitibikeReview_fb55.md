Null hypothesis properly formulated, however: communitng means goint to work/school I think you mean more likely to use citibike in general, not for commuting (generally no commuting on weekends)

THE FORMULAE MAKE NO SENSE! what is ;=? should be <=, or >=, and < or > in the Ha. Please correct! (confusion with foreign keyboard??)

Dara wrangle phase is fine, and it looks like you may have an interesting result.

A test of proportion (z for proportion or chi sq) is appropriate.
