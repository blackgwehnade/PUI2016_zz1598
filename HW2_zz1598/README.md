# HW2 Information

### * Groupwork: In addition to individual work, I also discussed some thoughts with Dongjie Fan about finding the best way to synchronize the compute, local files and github. Besides, I also helped two other classmates with choosing Python editors for writing python script. 

## Assignment 1
### I got the API Key from MTA website, and used it to get bus information in Json format. It took me some time to observe the format of the loops and get the bus locations. 

## Assignment 2
### I bbserved the "Onwardcalls" format and got the info of the bus stop names and status. 
#### Note: Not quite sure if I wrote the .csv file correctly... 

## Assignment 3
### On compute, I searched on Google and figured out how to check Env Var using Python. Picked a dataset on Datahub, confirmed the path to its location on compute, and then consulted the class note to plot the scatter plot for the dataset I picked.

## Extra Credit
### On compute, I picked a new dataset with data&time. (I used Zipcode, which should be a category, but in this assignment I treated it as a dependent variable for pattern observation because it could indicate the location of the buildings.
### Note: I tried to plot a scatter plot of the time series using the same method as that in Assignment 3, but error occured. I read some materials about Time Series plots of pandas, and plotted a Time Series line plot.
