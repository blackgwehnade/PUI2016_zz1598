## On compute, set up
## 1. an environment variable PUI2016(showing the full path to the dir PUI2016)
## 2. an alias pui2016(directing to the dir PUI2016 immediately)
###
### Details:
### Before I started coding, Dongjie Fan mentioned that he had created an environment variable, but it was a temporary
### one. So I was aware of that when I started. I also watched the a YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suci36U_hE)
### that teaches how to create, change and delete a permanent env var on OS X bash. I first did it on my own machine(Mac), and then did
### it on the CUSP compute, by changing the command a little bit to fit the Linux system(i.e. using vi instead of vim).
