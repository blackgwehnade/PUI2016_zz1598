# HW5 Information

### * Groupwork: I worked with Dongjie Fan to interpret different distributions, statistcal tests and their implications. We helped each other gain some insights from the tests. 

## Assignment 1
### I used KS and Anderson tests to see if the age distribution follows a normal distribution and a exponential distribution; I also used KS and Chisquare tests for a poisson distribution. I still have some problems regarding discrete distribution and continuous ones; when and how a discrete distribution can be transformed to a continuous one? Also I wonder how to read the resultes of a chisquare test for distribution fitting? I am going to gather my questions and come to the office hour.

## Assignment 2
### For this assignment I spent some time figuring out the how to get the rows and columns I wanted from the excel table, especially when there were some colums being merged while some were not. I really liked the step by step way of approaching the results. I am going to apply this skeleton in my future assignments and projects.

## Assignment 3
### Practice formulating the null hypothesis
Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

#### • Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.
#### Null Hypothesis: 
The average decrease in weight among a group of people only on diets is the same as the average decease in weight of a similar group only taking exercise in a 30 days. <br />
**H0: weight loss(diet) - weight loss(exercise) <= 0**  (weight loss is positive; weight gain is negative)

#### • Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.
#### Null Hypothesis: 
Percentage of participants in the 1994 poll who voted 'yes' was the same or smaller than that of those who voted 'no' or 'other'<br />
**H0: %yes votes - %no/other votes <= 0**

#### • Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.
#### Null Hypothesis: 
The successful smoking quit rate among people assigned to use nicotine patches is the same or less than that of people assigned to use placebo patches.<br />
**H0: smoking quit rate(nicotine patche group) - smoking quit rate(placebo patche group) <= 0**

#### • Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.
#### Null Hypothesis: 
1. The average IQ of a group of children at ages 1,2,3 and 4 whose mothers were smoking during pregnancy is the same or higher than a group of children at ages 1,2,3 and 4 whose mothers were non-smokers and not being affected by second hand smoking during pregnancy.<br />

2. The average increasing rate of IQ from age 1-4 of the children whose mothers were smoking during pregnancy is the same or higher than that of the children whose mothers were non-smokers and not being affected by second hand smoking during pregnancy.<br />
**H0: average increase rate in IQ(children with smoker mothers during pregnancy) - average increase rate in IQ(children with non-smoker mothers during pregnancy) >= 0**
