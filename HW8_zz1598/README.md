## Assignment 1
### I followed the instructions of the lab work and finished the data cleaning and merging part. The most challenging part for me was the "harmonizing" task using regular expressions to convert the long community district names to the shortened IDs. ### Then I did an analysis to see how demographic and infrastructure conditions could affect the number of complaints in the community districts. I ran the OLS regression model using both the number of people and normalized percentages from which I got different results. This might be due to some limits in data collection and processing-- please find more details in my notebook.
