## Assignment 1
### I followed the instructions of lad and finished the data cleaning and merging part. The most challenging part for me was the "harmonizing" task using the regular expression to convert the long community district names to the ids. Then I did an analysis to see how demographic and infrastructure conditions could affect the number of complaints in the community districts. There were limits in data and inaccuracy in results so I mentioned that in the notebook.
