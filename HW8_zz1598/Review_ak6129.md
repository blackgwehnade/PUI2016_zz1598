## Review
### Data processing part for the plot
Each step of your data processing is clear and easy to undertand. You count the total number of injuries in NYC from 2009 to 2015 and plot them in your graph.

### Plot Evaluation- Clarity, Aesthetic, and Honesty
Your plot has a good clarity with titles, names(labels) of the x and y axes, and a legend. I like the color and the trangle marker you pick for the data points in your plot. The data points are nicely connected so I can see the changes from year to year. The size of the figure are also good. The data is honestly presented without hidding any information(you use the total counts).

The only thing I would suggest is the ticker on the x-axis. I see that you put a "2.009e3" on the right side of the x-axis. I guess that you mean to label it as "2009". If this is the case, then converting to a string could solve the problem. Or how about putting a "2009-2015" instead? I think it might be clearer if you set the x-axis' ticks as years(i.e.2009, 2010, 2011...,2015). You could also place a tick "14500" at the botton of the y-axis so the reader would know your y-axis starts from 14500 instead of "0". 

Great job!
